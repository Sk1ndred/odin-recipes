    <h3>I stole the basis of this recipe off of Nigella. I added some meat to help to cure that hangover itch. Don't forget to have some good bread to mop up the yummy tomato sauce at the end.</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic, diced</li>
            <li>130g pack of pancetta</li>
            <li>1 heaped teaspoon of chilli flakes</li>
            <li>1 tin of tomato sauce</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>10g of grated parmigiano reggiano</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a pan on a medium heat hob and heat the olive oil.</li>
            <li>Cook the pancetta until it's almost done and then add the diced ginger.</li>
            <li>Once the pancetta and ginger are cooked, add the chilli flakes and mix them around in the oil.</li>

            <li>Crack the 4 eggs into the sauce, sprinkle on the cheese and cover.</li>
            <li>Cook until the eggs are poached to your liking and serve with a hunk of bread.</li>
        </ol>
